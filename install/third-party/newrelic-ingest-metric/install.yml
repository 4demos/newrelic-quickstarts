description: Use this quickstart to set up a synthetic monitor that:
  1. Queries ingestion by data source, faceted by the attribute of your choice (e.g., APM Events by appName)
  2. Transforms the output into a metric that is pushed to the Metric API
  3. Can be queried for consumption analysis / dashboards for 13 months
