  [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/)Â is an MLOps platform that extends full stack observability to machine learning models, and allows you to establish production performance baselines based on model performance. The Comet integration allows you to integrate machine learning metrics with New Relic, so you can continuosly monitor your data across the full machine learning lifecycle. This helps ensure optimal model performance, and helps you achieve better business outcomes.

  Use New Relic's Comet integration to get data and insights that help you build better, more accurate machine-learning models, while also improving productivity, collaboration, and visibility across your team.
