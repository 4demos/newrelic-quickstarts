  ## Comprehensive monitoring for your lighttpd server

  lighttpd is an open-source web server designed for high-performance situations while staying standards-compliant, secure, and adaptable.

  ### Why monitor your lighttpd server?

  lighttpd monitoring provides important information to help you construct a complete picture of your web server's performance. This performance data includes uptime, network in bytes and packets, number of connections, and more.

  ### Whatâ€™s included?

  When you monitor your lighttpd server with New Relic, you get immediate full-stack observability, including:
  - Be alerted on things like average number of connections, average number of requests and high memory usage.
  - Use dashboards to monitor crucial performance metrics, such as uptime, connection state handle request, connection state still alive, networks, requests per second, and more.
