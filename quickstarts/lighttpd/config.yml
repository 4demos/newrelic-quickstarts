  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Lighttpd

  Lighttpd is an open-source web server designed for high-performance situations while staying standards-compliant, secure and adaptable.

  ### Why monitor Lighttpd?

  Lighttpd monitoring provides developers with important information to help them construct a complete picture of a web server's performance. This data comprises error analytics, network in bytes and packets, host-related resource metrics, throughput, latency, server performance, and activity metrics.

  ### Whatâ€™s included?

  The Lighttpd monitoring quickstart from New Relic provides immediate full-stack observability:
  - Alerts including high CPU utilization, high memory usage, transaction error.
  - Dashboards (Throughput, Error rate, Logs, Uptime, busy server, networks, requests per second and more).
  - Actively monitor where you should focus your efforts and fix potential issues as soon as possible.

  Monitor and verify your Lighttpd processes with our Infrastructure agent and Prometheus open metric integration. Analyze and capture the performance data right out of the box.
