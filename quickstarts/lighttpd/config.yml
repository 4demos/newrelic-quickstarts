  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Lighttpd

  Lighttpd is an open-source web server designed for high-performance situations while staying standards-compliant, secure and adaptable.

  ### Why monitor Lighttpd?

  Lighttpd monitoring provides important information to help the developers construct a complete picture of a web server's performance. This data comprises uptime, network in bytes and packets, number of connections and more.

  ### Whatâ€™s included?

  The Lighttpd monitoring quickstart from New Relic provides immediate full-stack observability:
  - Alerts (average number of connections, average number of requests, high memory usage).
  - Dashboards (uptime, connection state handle request, connection state still alive, networks, requests per second and more).
  - Be proactive in monitoring potential issues and resolving them as soon as possible.

summary: |
   With our Infrastructure agent and Flex configuration setup, you can monitor and validate your Lighttpd processes. Right out of the box, analyze and capture performance data.
