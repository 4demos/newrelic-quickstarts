  ## Why monitor JFrog Platform
  This is an integration between the JFrog Platform and the New Relic Observability platform for log analytics.

  ### JFrog Platform quickstart highlights
  The integration will surface Platform Logs, Xray Violations data and system performance data available through Open Metrics, as pre-built dashboards within a JFrog Platform application made available within the New Relic One Programmable Observability platform. This will provide JFrog customers using New Relic a convenient, single location to view logs and metrics for the JFrog platform. The integration will utilize FluentD, which is open source and is considered one of the most lightweight log processor and forwarder in the market. In this implementation custom log parsers will be used with FluentD for any types not covered by generic parsers

summary: |
  FluentD-based custom log forwarder for the JFrog platform for customers using New Relic's observability platform
