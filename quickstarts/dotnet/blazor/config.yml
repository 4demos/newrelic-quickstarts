  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Blazor

  Microsoft developed Blazor to build web UIs with C#, HTML, and CSS. As a feature of ASP.NET, our Blazor integration with the .NET agent lets you monitor your apps with our quickstart dashboards right out of the box.


  ## Why monitor Blazor?

  Blazor offers a lot of useful features in addition to allowing C# developers to utilize their preferred language for web development. Blazor allows you to run your code through WebAssembly on the server or the client, and you can decide which users or devices experience each method.
  
  There are a few compelling arguments that support the employment of Blazor:
  - All of the major browsers support WebAssembly.
  - Using C# for interactive web apps.
  - Utilize current C# libraries.
  - Near-native performance.
  - Debugging and tooling.

  ## Whatâ€™s included in this quickstart?
