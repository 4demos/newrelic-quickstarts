  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Ado.net

  With New Relic's ADO.NET monitoring system, you can observe your ADO.NET data set in real-time. Our .NET agent will also let you correlate transactions moving across your application environment and troubleshoot while working in a live development environment.


  ## Why monitor ADO.NET?

  Discovering data access API calls can help in identifying the following issues:
    - Inaccessible databases or issues with the network library.
    - Database and client software schema incompatibility.
    - Problems occur when different ADO.NET components interact with one another or your own components.
    - Whether hard-coded or created by an application, incorrect SQL.
    - Flawed programming logic.

  ## Whatâ€™s included in this quickstart?

  The ADO.NET monitoring quickstart from New Relic provides immediate full-stack observability:
    - Alerts (High load connection, Hard connects exceeding max limit, Pool size exceeding optimum limit).
    - Dashboards (Hard connects per second, Hard disconnects per second, Number of active connections, Soft connects per second,  and more).
    - Alerts inform end users about the quality of their applications on a proactive basis.
    - Monitor web transactions.
