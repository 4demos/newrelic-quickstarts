  ## Postman's New Relic Integration

  Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and
  streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster. Postman's integration with New Relic allows
  you to observe the performance of your APIs by sending results from Postman Monitor to New Relic and returning
  critical API performance data back to Postman's API platform.
