  # Complete Apache Monitoring Kit
  ## Understanding Apache
  The Apache HTTP Server is a free and open-source, secure, efficient, and extensible HTTP web server
  for the Windows and UNIX operating systems. It has been around since the mid-90s, and it is the most popular web server available on the internet.

  ## Why monitor Apache HTTP Server?
  Succinctly put, web servers are computers that run web applications. So given the essentiality of a
  webserver to an IT infrastructure, it is paramount to monitor its operations to ensure continual
  optimal performance. Their performance level is crucial to optimizing uptimes for web applications.

  ## What should you look for in an Apache HTTP Server Monitor?
  Any rudimentary Apache dashboard must provide developers with enough information to ascertain
  that a web server promptly accepts requests and serves them with accurate responses. However, an
  ideal Apache performance monitoring tool must provide more comprehensive details. A great
  Apache monitor offers developers critical information to help them paint a complete picture of a web server's performance. Such data includes error analytics, host-related resource metrics,
  throughput metrics, latency metrics, resource utilization metrics, and activity metrics.

  ## Whatâ€™s Included?
  Our kit offers ready to use dashboards including:
  - servers reporting
  - total requests per second
  - requests per second by server
  - worker status, and more

  ## What makes New Relic's kit unique?
  In designing our kit, our team reflected on the critical design attributes a monitor must embody to be considered adequate and efficient. To that end, they deduced that firstly, a monitor must feature an intuitive design that allows developers to look up their preferred performance-related data quickly.
  Secondly, it must also feature an efficient issue resolution process. To realize an implementation
  representative of these inferences, we developed a kit that combines practicality and usability to
  achieve an unprecedented user experience in performance tracking.
