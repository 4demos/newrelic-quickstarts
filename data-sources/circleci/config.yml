  ## CircleCI Quickstart

  The worldâ€™s best software teams use CircleCI to deliver quality code with confidence. As the largest continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform, CircleCI empowers engineers to seamlessly take ideas to execution, at scale. Every feature of our platform is built to fine-tune the entire development process from start to finish.

  This quickstart allows users to view analytical data about their CircleCI jobs within the New Relic dashboard to gain visibility into the performance and health of their continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

  ### With the CircleCI quickstart you can:

  - Monitor real-time CI performance, activity, and health, or track over time.
  - Identify opportunities for optimization.

  ## The CircleCI quickstart includes a dashboard where users can easily monitor:
  - Total Jobs Ran
  - Job Health (% success)
  - Projects Summary
