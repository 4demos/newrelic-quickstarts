  ## Comprehensive MEAN stack monitoring system

  MEAN stack is an open source JavaScript-based web application development framework for building dynamic websites and web applications.
  Since all the components are based on JavaScript and JSON, the integration between the components of the stack is intuitive and straightforward.
  Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of the web applications.

  ## What should you look for in a MEAN dashboard?
  - Metrics of MongoDB, i.e. number of active connections, database details, usage time and many more.
  - Metrics of ExpressJS, NodeJS, i.e. number of web transactions, top 10 transactions and the transactions error, memory usage and many more.
  - Metrics of Angular, i.e. number of viewed urls, page views by city, ajax requests and many more. You are also free to create your own chart by using the stored metrics.
